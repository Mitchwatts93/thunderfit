instant fixes:

DONE? 1. fix data plot at the end, looks like its plotting y_data_bg_rm
3. move bound making into peak finding
4. generate model should be made more generic so a function can be passed and used.
6. write a routine for map scans - things like using peak params from last fit etc.



New features:

##### DONE-User guided decision on how many peaks to fit?

##### Background: 
##### DONE -Add if statement to scarf so list can be passed and multiple calls can be made 
##### DONE -change scarf so background shift is calculated from minimum if no value is passed
##### Done -return scarf parameters from scarf fit and edit all code that uses it

Multiobj:
Done - add method to read map scan file and store that info also, maybe add variables for storing map scan parameters/details
-add method to do user guided background for first fit, and then use those scarf parameters for all else, except background shift which will be calculated for each case
-find peaks for first fit by user guided/normal way, if not supplied, and then use those peaks parameters for all other fits
-make a method to extract a peak value from each location which is consistent, or null if not available. E.g. find the peak position corresponding to that peak in the first location
-make a fit report for the whole bag of objects, e.g. the parameters used, the fit details at each, scarf parameters, chi sq and p value etc

Plotting:
-make a method for map scans given a parameter for each location, e.g. width
-method for plotting grid over an image

Make a map scan routine:
-create a multiobj
-background substraction on each location based on the first fit or parameters
-find peaks for all based in first location/parameters
-fit peaks to each location and store their info
-plot some variable from each location on a map
-create and save a fit report
-save the bag of objects
