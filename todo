Urgent:
- update instructions


next up:
- general analysis 
- general batch run
- check background as failed plots bg plot looks unsmoothed
- properly parse user args to make sure they are consistent with each other, e.g. if no_peaks isn't passed but peak details are then just work it out etc.
- what happens if you give parameters that don't exist for that model?
- whats going on with splitlorentzianmodel?
- figure out how to do an arbitrary user supplied model
- why don't step models work in mapscan plot?

not urgent:
- method for plotting grid over an image of the mapscan
- close plots on mapscan when done??? HOW? plt.close() messes everything up or does nothing
- check mapscan plots etc all work without the mapscan routine
- bootstrapping for errors
- comment everything
- change peak_info_dict to a peak params object everywhere
- support form argument for models

Unsupported models:
- custom
- step models of any kind
- split lorentzian
- maybe exponentialgaussian?

TESTING needed
==============
- test other peak types
- implement methods of fit etc for thunder objects


Finished
========
- when fails lower the tolerance
- tolerance options
- save params file in folder when created
- for mapscan plots add option to plot all
- peak sharpening in
- test peak finding
- test no bounds
- test bounds
- test no peaks and no peakfinding
- implement another bound generator
- delete bounds generation for amplitude
- get rid of tightness
- fix peak_info keys
- fix the gen params script so it only calls the peak_finder functions 
- cleanup object methods in thunder obj to have e.g. clip, remove bg, find peak, fit etc
- make peak finder user guided properly display widths and amplitude as atm is only for centers
