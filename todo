Fitting/finding:
- generate model should be made more generic so a function can be passed and used.
- If using user-supplied params, give the option to tweak them so that bounds can still be automatically found. i.e. for peaks do peakfinder and choose the closest to those numbers? 

Plotting:
- method for plotting grid over an image of the mapscan
- close plots on mapscan when done??? HOW? plt.close() messes everything up or does nothing

Misc:
- move logging to a log file which is saved and change all prints to logging: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig, https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html, https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-to-multiple-destinations
- figure out what to do with uncertainty on y values?

TESTING needed
==============
- pass logger object around/get logger whenever needed
- improve logging
