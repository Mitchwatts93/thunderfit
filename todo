====

Fitting/finding:
- generate model should be made more generic so a function can be passed and used.


Plotting:
- method for plotting grid over an image of the mapscan


Misc:
- figure out what to do with uncertainty on y values?
- comment everything
- check background as failed plots bg plot looks unsmoothed
- when fails lower the tolerance

TESTING needed
==============
- close plots on mapscan when done??? HOW? plt.close() messes everything up or does nothing
