Fitting/finding:
- generate model should be made more generic so a function can be passed and used.
- If using user-supplied params, give the option to tweak them so that bounds can still be automatically found. i.e. for peaks do peakfinder and choose the closest to those numbers? 

Plotting:
- method for plotting grid over an image of the mapscan

Background:
- currently passing a bg as an np array doesn't work

Misc:
- Tidy up mapscan and move some functions into the bag object/make a new module with all the specific mapscan functions in it
- move logging to a log file which is saved and change all prints to logging
- replace all dictionary fetching with getattr with a correct default value!
- tidy up imports to only be what is needed
- init all values for multiobj and thunderobj


TESTING needed
==============

- some peaks are failing to fit, ensure that when they fail a good value is saved as parameter values so that map can still be trusted : using best_values from fitting routine, should maybe just be using none???

- close plots on mapscan when done

- when a model fails to fit, record the number in a dict and save that dict to the bag object. at the end plot all the failed fits...

- move bound making into peak finding
