Fitting/finding:
- move bound making into peak finding
- generate model should be made more generic so a function can be passed and used.
- some peaks are failing to fit, ensure that when they fail a good value is saved as parameter values so that map can still be trusted, and save the plots that fail for user inspection - if its due to widths or amplitude bounds then investigate how to fix

Plotting:
- method for plotting grid over an image

Background:
- currently passing a bg as an np array doesn't work
- check that scarf is always moothing, some mapscan results seem like it isn't

Give opportunity to choose a spectrum other than the first to choose background and peaak centres etc.


TESTING needed:
